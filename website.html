    <p style="max-width:fit-content">I am learning how to make a website! Websites are written in a language called HTML.
    <p>In the below section I will be showing you how we can format text on the webpage.<br>
    <b>This sentence is bold.</b><i>This sentence is in italics.</i><u>This sentence is underlined.</u></p>
    <p style="color:red; max-width:500px;font-weight: bold;">This entire paragraph is red and bold. 
        <span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace">I have changed the font type for this sentence.</span> 
        In this sentence, <sup>this part is in superscript</sup>, but <sub>this part is in subscript</sub>. 
        <del>This part is struckthrough</del>! 
        <tt>This is typewritten text (although I am not sure if kids today even know what typewriters are!)</tt> 
        <pre>This is   pre-formatted text  ,  which means the browser will not ignore multiple spaces.</pre></p>
